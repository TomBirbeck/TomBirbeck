# Hey There, I’m Tom
I started coding about a year ago and in that time I've come to enjoy constant error messages! Genuinely love coding and learning new ways of doing things within an ever evolving ecosystem.\
I have just graduated from <a href='https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk/' target='_blank'>The School of Code</a> boot camp and I'm now continuing to learn new things and creating some projects to help me put them into practice. Recently had a dabble with the exciting React Native, currently enjoying some Frontend Mentor challenges and researching Vue.js.
