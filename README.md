# Hey There, I’m Tom
I orginally got started a bit of coding on recommdation from my wife and I've come to enjoy constant error messages! Genuinely love coding and learning new ways of doing things. I introduced her to facon (tis is not a typo, just what I call vegan bacon) and waffle sandwiches years ago so we're even now really...
I have just graduated from The School of Code and I'm now continuing to learn new things and creating some projects to help me put them into practice. I have been mainly looking at Typescript recently, which is great but also feels like a small child constantly kicking you in the shins.
